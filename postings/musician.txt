Full job description
I started a kids music program (ages 0-7+) in the pandemic, and I need people to take parties and sub classes for me! Classes start at $50 and pay more based on attendance. Parties start at $150 for a 30 minute set, and they can get up to $300 or more for longer parties or further distance traveled.
Experience playing guitar and singing is a must. Any experience working with kids is helpful. References will be requested.
Parties and classes are mostly in North NJ and NYC. Occasionally we get requests for parties in further areas, and the pay is higher for the travel. I am specifically looking for someone who can travel around North NJ.
